StumbleUpon's Async Library - User visible changes.

* Version 1.1.0 (2011-09-27) [cf62d8d]

New public APIs:
  - The `join()' and `joinUninterruptibly()' methods now have an
    overloaded version that accepts a timeout in milliseconds and
    throws the new `TimeoutException' when a timed join times out.

Noteworthy changes:
  - Callback chains are now stored in an array internally, instead of 2
    LinkedLists, which dramatically reduces memory usage and the number
    of objects created for each callback.


* Version 1.0 (2010-10-26) [80c1235]

Noteworthy changes:
  - `MAX_CALLBACK_CHAIN_LENGTH' was increased from 64 to 127.
  - Switch from LGPLv3+ to BSD license.
  - Fix `join()' and `joinUninterruptibly()' to be safe with multiple
    waiting threads.
  - Fix a race condition when adding a callback right before the end
    of the execution of the current callback chain.
  - Optimization: invoke callbacks immediately when added to a Deferred
    already in `State.DONE'.

New public APIs:
  - `Deferred.group()' and `DeferredGroupException' were added.


* Version 0.1 (2010-08-26) [d955ddb]

Initial release:
  - Deferred with Callback, inspired from Twisted's defer.py.
