  | StumbleUpon's Async Library |
  `-----------------------------'

This Java library provides some useful building blocks to build
high-performance multi-threaded asynchronous applications in Java.
Its implementation was inspired by Twisted's asynchronous library
(twisted.internet.defer).

Deferred allows you to easily build asynchronous processing chains
that must trigger when an asynchronous event (I/O, RPC and whatnot)
completes.  It can be used extensively to build an asynchronous API
in a multi-threaded server or client library.
